Question - You're about to start your new job at a cool Amsterdam startup. What do you favor the most?
Pick one 1 .
a. Choose your own hardware, be forced to work with a company supplied operating
system image.

I would Pick Option a. Well, I can still have my own Operating System through a Virtual Box :-)
